Variable names can't begin with numbers and don't contain spaces

var myVar; // naming the variable
myVar = 5; // assigning a value to the variable

var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a; // assigning variable "a" to "b" when "b" is called it returns "a"

const variables are read-only meaning they cannot be changed

let myVar = 87;
myVar++; //incrementing a number

let myVar = 87;
myVar--; // decrementing a number

decimals are referred to as floating point numbers or floats

the remainder % operator gives the value of the division of two numbers
5 % 2 = 1 // one is the remainder
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient) // breaking down 5 % 2 = 1
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (remainder)

compound assignment with augmented additions
let myVar = 2;
myVar += 3;
console.log(myVar);

Escaping literal quotes in strings
const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
const myVar = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";

Quoting strings with a single quotes
const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, lets\'s go on an adventure?"';

double quote -  \"
backslash - \\
newline - \n
